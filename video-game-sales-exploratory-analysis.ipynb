This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\".\n","\n","\n","#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n","\n","1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Add Conda binaries to your system `PATH`, so you can use the `conda` command on your terminal.\n","\n","2. Create a Conda environment and install the required libraries by running these commands on the terminal:\n","\n","```\n","conda create -n zerotopandas -y python=3.8 \n","conda activate zerotopandas\n","pip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opendatasets --upgrade\n","```\n","\n","3. Press the \"Clone\" button above to copy the command for downloading the notebook, and run it on the terminal. This will create a new directory and download the notebook. The command will look something like this:\n","\n","```\n","jovian clone notebook-owner/notebook-id\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","4. Enter the newly created directory using `cd directory-name` and start the Jupyter notebook.\n","\n","```\n","jupyter notebook\n","```\n","\n","You can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser.
