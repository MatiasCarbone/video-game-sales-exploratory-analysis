Create a Conda environment and install the required libraries by running these commands on the terminal:\n","\n","```\n","conda create -n zerotopandas -y python=3.8 \n","conda activate zerotopandas\n","pip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opendatasets --upgrade\n","```\n","\n","3. Press the \"Clone\" button above to copy the command for downloading the notebook, and run it on the terminal. This will create a new directory and download the notebook.
